# Introduction to Programming Website

Live at: [https://itp.zohair.dev/](https://itp.zohair.dev/)

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

We use Netlify for deployment. The website is automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
