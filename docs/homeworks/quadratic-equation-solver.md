# Quadriatic Equation Solver

In this assignment, you will be writing a Python program that solves quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation in a single variable `x` with the form:

$$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $$

The solutions to a quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

Your task is to write a Python program that takes the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` as input and calculates the roots of the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. The program should output the roots of the equation.

For example, given the coefficients `a = 5`, `b = 6`, and `c = 1`, the program should output the roots `x1 = -0.2` and `x2 = -1.0`.
